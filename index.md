# Welcome to the Modern Hobbyist Wiki

Welcome to my digital knowledge base! This wiki is a collection of everything I've learned while diving into 3D printing, CNC machining, electronics, and countless other projects. But more importantly, it's about **how** I learned these things—my process for tackling subjects I knew absolutely nothing about.

## Why This Wiki Exists
I've spent years experimenting, troubleshooting, and figuring things out the hard way. While there are plenty of guides and tutorials out there on **what** to do, I found that the biggest challenge was often understanding **how** to start learning in the first place. This wiki is my attempt to document not just my (very limited) knowledge but also my learning journey—so you can see the paths I took, the mistakes I made, and the strategies that worked best.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Project Breakdowns** – Step-by-step insights into projects I've built, from custom mechanical keyboards to entire DIY CNC Machines.
- **Learning Strategies** – My approach to picking up complex skills, from decoding technical documentation to troubleshooting hardware issues.
- **Tools & Resources** – The books, videos, forums, and courses that helped me the most.
- **Failures & Fixes** – The things that went wrong and what I did to recover.
- **Continuous Learning** – How I stay up-to-date with rapidly evolving technologies.

## Who This Is For
This wiki is for makers, tinkerers, and anyone who wants to take on new technical challenges but isn't sure where to start. Whether you're diving into 3D printing, designing PCBs, or automating your workshop, I hope my experiences help make your learning journey smoother.

## How to Use This Wiki
You can browse through topics using the sidebar or search for specific subjects. If you're looking for guidance on how to approach a brand-new skill, check out the **Learning Strategies** section.

This is a living document, and I'll be updating it as I learn more. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Happy making!
